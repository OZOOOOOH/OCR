Now in its fourth year, the State of Al Report 2021 is reviewed by Al practioners in industry and
research, and features invited contributions from a range of well-known and up-and-coming
companies and research groups. The Report considers the following key dimensions:

 

* Research: Technology breakthroughs and capabilities.
* Talent: Supply, demand and concentration of Al talent.

«Industry: Areas of commercial application for Al and its business impact.

* Politics: Regulation of Al, its economic implications and the emerging geopolitics of Al.

* Predictions: What we believe will happen and a performance review to keep us honest.

Key themes in the 2021 Report include:

* Al is stepping up in more concrete ways, including being applied to mission critical
infrastructure like national electric grids and automated supermarket warehousing
optimization during pandemics.

* Al-first approaches have taken biology by storm with faster simulations of humans’ cellular
machinery {proteins and RNA). This has the potential to transform drug discovery and
healthcare.

* Transformers have emerged as a general purpose architecture for machine learning, beating
the state of the art in many domains including NLP, computer vision, and even protein
structure prediction.

* Investors have taken notice, with record funding this year into Al startups, and two first ever
IPOs for Al-first drug discovery companies, as well as blockbuster IPOs for data
infrastructure and cybersecurity companies that help enterprises retool for the Al-first era.

© The under-resourced Al-alignment efforts from key organisations who are advancing the
overall field of Al, as well as concerns about datasets used to train Al models and bias in
model evaluation benchmarks, raises important questions about how best to chart the

* Al is now an actual arms race rather than a figurative one. Al researchers have traditionally
seen the Al arms race as a figurative one -- simulated dogfights between competing Al
systems carried out in labs -- but that is changing with reports of recent use of autonomous
weapons by various militaries.
